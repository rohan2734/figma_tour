we can choose the star from the tool 
where rectangle is chosen 

and we can also increase the count and decrease 
by zooming in , selecting the edge, and moving up
and down (point towards edge)

we can also change the ratio by 
dragging the point of intersection between 
two ends of the star 

you cant create a component out of another component 

now after creating the component
make one star fit into the component 
duplicate the star inside that  
and make 3 duplicates of it
1.filled
2.half filled 
3. unfilled

turn the filled and half filled color to gold 
and unfilled to empty 

and now make a rectangle 
and place it half on that star 
and use intersection property
