 I used 1 layer of shadow to make
  the payment card stand out from the
   rest of the page since it's
    the focal point of the interface 
    and then a second layer with more
     blur that gives the card an
      impression of depth. 


Another example which I really
 like is applying similar shadow
  styles to website buttons and 
  then increasing the shadow when 
  a user hovers over the button to
   again add that depth of field.
