* variants is a great tool to create multiple instances of the component 
* select both the components, and select the variance 

* also now select the three buttons, and duplicate with Ctrl+d 
* and now add a property, add size 
* add a new value , on the default as small and large 

* a disabled small button , and a pressed small button 

* we are also going to create a buttons with logos also
* so add a new property called With icon and change it to default 

* so do the ctrl + alt ,and create the duplicate inside the variance only 
* otherwise it wont be a variant anymore 

* we can use the shortcut ctrl + shit + alt  ,and holding that select the text and click the text align:left 
* now the butons without icon , seelct them and add new value of false 
* and set it to false
