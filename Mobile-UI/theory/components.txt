* components in figma are very useful 
* if we have a frame, where the roundness is 25, and the duplicates of it are also 25 
* but when we change the roundness from 25 to 15 of first frame , the other two frames . the changes are not reflected 

* so here the components come into play
* we can convert the frames into components

components can be any part of the design that can be duplicated , with certain characteristics, and if you want to change the characteristics, you can maintain the changes in every place, rather than we changing it

* now you can select what you want to make the component, and click on ctrl+alt+k
* and click on ctrl+alt to copy and drag it and paste in other screen to creat an instance of that component 
* to check if it is the master component or not, you can see a filled diamond for master component 
* and unfilled diamond for instance of the master component

* for the first component, you cannot change the icons, as we did on the display for the other two since, it is the master component
* so we create one  more instacnce of that master component

* do the same with a button as a component in first screen
